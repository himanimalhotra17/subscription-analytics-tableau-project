🚀 Just completed a Subscription Analytics Dashboard to analyze Retention, Churn, LTV, and Customer Segmentation using Tableau.

Subscription businesses rely heavily on retaining high-value customers, but identifying churn risks and understanding lifetime value is often challenging. I built this project to simulate a real SaaS product analytics scenario and uncover actionable insights across the customer lifecycle.

📊 **What the dashboard covers:**

• Executive overview with Revenue, Active Users, LTV, and Churn Rate
• Cohort retention analysis to track user engagement over time
• Churn analysis by acquisition channel and subscription plan
• Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) analysis to identify high-value segments
• RFM segmentation to categorize users into Champions, Loyal, At-Risk, and Lost customers
• Subscription funnel analysis from signup to repeat subscription

🔍 **Key insights:**

• Premium plan users generated significantly higher lifetime value
• Paid channels drove user acquisition but showed lower retention
• A small segment of “Champions” contributed a large share of total revenue
• Declining engagement was a strong early indicator of churn

📈 **Skills demonstrated:** Product Analytics, Cohort Analysis, LTV Modeling, Customer Segmentation, Dashboard Design

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of subscription metrics and how data can drive retention and growth strategies.

🚀 Product Analytics Project: Subscription Retention, Churn & LTV Dashboard (Tableau)

I recently built a product analytics dashboard simulating a SaaS subscription business to answer a core product question:

👉 *Why do users churn, and how can we retain high-value customers?*

Instead of just reporting metrics, I approached this from a product decision-making lens — focusing on lifecycle behavior, engagement signals, and revenue impact.

📊 **What I analyzed:**

• Cohort retention trends to understand long-term engagement
• Churn drivers by acquisition channel and subscription plan
• Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) by segment
• RFM segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to identify:

* Champions
* Loyal users
* At-risk customers
* Lost users
  • Subscription funnel from Signup → First Payment → Repeat Subscription

🔎 **Key Product Insights:**

• High acquisition ≠ high retention — paid channels drove volume but lower LTV
• Engagement drop preceded churn, indicating potential early warning signals
• A small “Champion” segment contributed a disproportionate share of revenue
• Retention stabilized after the third billing cycle — critical activation window

💡 **Product Implications:**

• Improve onboarding experience during first 30 days
• Build nudges for declining engagement users
• Target retention campaigns toward high-monetary, low-recency users
• Optimize marketing spend toward high-LTV acquisition channels


📈 Skills: Product Analytics, Cohort Analysis, LTV Modeling, Customer Segmentation, Data Storytelling

This project strengthened my ability to connect user behavior to business impact and think beyond dashboards toward product decisions.

# Subscription Product Analytics Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the full customer lifecycle of a subscription-based digital product.  
The objective was to identify conversion bottlenecks, optimize retention, and improve customer lifetime value (LTV).

The analysis replicates a real-world Product Analyst workflow used in SaaS companies.

## 🎯 Business Questions

- Where do users drop off in the conversion funnel?
- What is the 30/60/90-day retention performance?
- Which acquisition channels drive highest LTV?
- How can high-value users be segmented?
- What product improvements would increase revenue?

---

## 📊 Analysis Framework

### 1️⃣ Funnel Analysis
Signup → Trial → Subscription → Retention

Identified conversion friction and drop-off percentages.

### 2️⃣ Cohort Retention Analysis
Tracked retention trends by signup month.

Used to evaluate product stickiness and engagement decay.

### 3️⃣ Activation & Stickiness
Measured:
- Activation Rate (within 7 days)
- DAU / MAU ratio
- Time to Value

### 4️⃣ Revenue & LTV Analysis
- ARPU calculation
- LTV distribution
- Revenue contribution by segment

### 5️⃣ RFM Segmentation
Segmented users into:
- Champions
- Loyal Customers
- At-Risk Users
- Low-Value Users

---

## 📈 Key Product Insights

- Largest drop-off occurs between Trial and Subscription
- Premium users generate significantly higher LTV
- Retention drops sharply after Month 1
- Referral channel shows strongest long-term retention
• High acquisition ≠ high retention — paid channels drove volume but lower LTV
• Engagement drop preceded churn, indicating potential early warning signals
• A small “Champion” segment contributed a disproportionate share of revenue
• Retention stabilized after the third billing cycle — critical activation window
---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

- Improve onboarding flow to increase activation
- Optimize pricing & trial-to-paid transition
- Focus retention campaigns on high-value segments
- Invest more in high-LTV acquisition channels
- Implement churn prediction model
