# Subscription Product Analytics Project
## Retention, Churn, LTV & RFM Analysis using Tableau


## 📌 Project Overview
### The Challenge 🚀
For any SaaS Subscription-based digital product business, high-value retention is the primary growth engine. But when retention fluctuates and acquisition costs climb, the "why" behind user churn often remains a mystery.

### The Project 📊
I built this SaaS Analytics Dashboard to simulate a real SaaS product analytics scenario and bridge the gap between raw data and strategic action.
#### Key Features:
**Retention Visibility:** Clear, cohort-based views of user longevity.

**Revenue Quality:** Deep dives into LTV distribution to identify where real value lives.

**Growth Levers:** Identifying precisely where to optimize the lifecycle for maximum impact.

Instead of just reporting metrics, I approached this from a product decision-making lens — focusing on lifecycle behavior, engagement signals, and revenue impact to identify conversion bottlenecks, optimize retention, and improve customer lifetime value (LTV) and enable product and growth teams to take actionable steps.

## 📊 **What I analyzed:**

• Cohort retention trends to understand long-term engagement

• Churn drivers by acquisition channel and subscription plan

• Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) optimization by segment

• Revenue Concentration and retention drop offs

• RFM segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to identify:
* Champions
* Loyal users
* At-risk customers
* Lost users

• Subscription funnel from Signup → Subscription → Retention

## 📈 Key Product Insights

- Premium plan users generated significantly higher lifetime value
- Referral channel shows strongest long-term retention
• High acquisition ≠ high retention — paid channels drove volume/acquisition but lower LTV/retention.
• Engagement drop preceded churn, indicating potential early warning signals, Declining engagement was a strong early indicator of churn
• Retention stabilized after the third billing cycle — critical activation window. At-risk users show declining engagement before churn.

### 📉 Retention Drop After 60 Days/ Early Churn is the Core Problem

Strong 30-day retention but a noticeable decline at 60–90 days — indicating engagement gaps post-trial.

Implication: Onboarding & activation improvements can drastically impact retention.

### 💰 Revenue is Highly Concentrated

Top 20% of users contribute a disproportionately large share of revenue.

### ⚠️ Cohort Quality Varies

Some acquisition cohorts show weaker long-term retention — suggesting channel quality differences.

Implication: Possible product-market fit or onboarding experience issue.


### 📈 📊LTV Distribution is Right-Skewed

A small high-value user segment drives significant revenue impact.
• A small “Champion” segment contributed a disproportionate share of revenue, Champions segment contributes majority of total revenue.

Implication: Growth strategy should balance acquisition + lifecycle optimization.
🔎 3. High LTV Users Are Long-Term Retained Users

Revenue compounds over time in subscription models.

Implication: Invest in engagement loops, loyalty benefits, renewal incentives.
