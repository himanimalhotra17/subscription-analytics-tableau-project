# Subscription Product Analytics Project
## Retention, Churn, LTV & RFM Analysis using Tableau

---

## 📌 Project Overview
### The Challenge 🚀
For any SaaS Subscription-based digital product business, high-value retention is the primary growth engine. But when retention fluctuates and acquisition costs climb, the "why" behind user churn often remains a mystery.

### The Project 📊
I built this SaaS Analytics Dashboard to simulate a real SaaS product analytics scenario and bridge the gap between raw data and strategic action.
#### Key Features:
**Retention Visibility:** Clear, cohort-based views of user longevity.

**Revenue Quality:** Deep dives into LTV distribution to identify where real value lives.

**Growth Levers:** Identifying precisely where to optimize the lifecycle for maximum impact.

Instead of just reporting metrics, I approached this from a product decision-making lens — focusing on lifecycle behavior, engagement signals, and revenue impact to identify conversion bottlenecks, optimize retention, and improve customer lifetime value (LTV) and enable product and growth teams to take actionable steps.

## 📊 **What I analyzed:**

• Cohort retention trends to understand long-term engagement

• Churn drivers by acquisition channel and subscription plan

• Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) optimization by segment

• Revenue Concentration and retention drop offs

• RFM segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to identify:
* Champions
* Loyal users
* At-risk customers
* Lost users

• Subscription funnel from Signup → Subscription → Retention

## 📈 Key Product Insights

### 📉 Retention Drop After 60 Days

Retention is strong for 30 days but drops significantly between 60–90 days. Users who survive past the third billing cycle tend to stabilize, marking this as the critical activation window

**Implication:** Onboarding, activation & engagement improvements can drastically impact retention.

### ⚠️ Cohort Quality Varies

Some acquisition cohorts show weaker long-term retention — suggesting channel quality differences.

**Implication:** Possible product-market fit or onboarding experience issue.

### 💰 Revenue is Highly Concentrated

Premium plan users and the "Champion" segment (top 20% of users) drive the vast majority of total revenue

**Implication:** Growth strategy should balance acquisition + lifecycle optimization.

### 📈 LTV Distribution is Right-Skewed

Premium plan users generated significantly higher lifetime value

High acquisition ≠ high retention — paid channels drove volume/acquisition but lower LTV/retention.

**Implication:** Invest in engagement loops, loyalty benefits, renewal incentives.
