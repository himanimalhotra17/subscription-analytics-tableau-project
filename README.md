# 📊Subscription Product Analytics Project
## Retention, Churn, LTV & RFM Analysis using Tableau


## 📌 Project Overview

### Business Problem
🚀Subscription-based digital product businesses rely heavily on retaining high-value customers.

However Business experiences:
-Fluctuating Retention rates
-Expensive Acquisition 
-Unclear revenue concentration
-Churn Risks 

Thus understanding lifetime value often gets challenging but the core product question remains:👉 *Why do users churn, and how can we retain high-value customers?*

So, I built this project to simulate a real SaaS product analytics scenario using a single executive dashboard to:
-Deliver Cohort-level retention visibility
-Uncover User Retention
-Diagnose clear Churn Behavior 
-Analyze Revenue quality and LTV distribution insights across the customer lifecycle.

Instead of just reporting metrics, I approached this from a product decision-making lens — focusing on lifecycle behavior, engagement signals, and revenue impact to identify conversion bottlenecks, optimize retention, and improve customer lifetime value (LTV) and enable product and growth teams to take actionable steps.

## 🎯 Business Questions

- Where do users drop off in the conversion funnel?
- What is the 30/60/90-day retention performance?
- Which acquisition channels drive highest LTV?
- How can high-value users be segmented?
- What product improvements would increase revenue?

---

## 📊 **What I analyzed:**

• Cohort retention trends to understand long-term engagement
• Churn drivers by acquisition channel and subscription plan
• Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) optimization by segment
• Revenue Concentration and retention drop offs
• RFM segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to identify:
* Champions
* Loyal users
* At-risk customers
* Lost users
• Subscription funnel from Signup → First Payment → Repeat Subscription


## 📌 Key KPIs Tracked

**📌 Retention Rate**

% of users still active after specific time intervals (30, 60, 90 days).

**📌 Churn Rate**

% of users who discontinued subscription within a given period.

**📌 Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**

Total revenue generated by a user over their subscription period.

**📌 Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**

**📌 Cohort-based Retention**

User retention grouped by subscription start month.

- DAU / MAU ratio
- Time to Value

### 4️⃣ Revenue & LTV Analysis
- ARPU calculation
- LTV distribution
- Revenue contribution by segment

### 3️⃣ Churn Analysis
Churn rate by Plan
Churn rate by Acquisition Channel
Monthly Churn Trend
Churn by User Segment
Insights:

Majority churn within first 2 months.

Lower-value plan users churn faster.

Long-term subscribers significantly increase LTV.
### 4️⃣ LTV Analysis

LTV by Channel
LTV by Plan
Cohort Revenue Trend
- Segment-wise LTV Comparison

Insights:

Top 20% users drive majority of revenue.

Long-retained cohorts generate exponential revenue growth.

Reducing early churn by 10% would significantly increase total LTV.

### 5️⃣ Subscription Funnel

Signup → Subscriber → Paying User → Repeat Subscriber

### 6️⃣ RFM Segmentation

Recency, Frequency, Monetary scoring
Customer segments (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, Lost)
Revenue contribution by segment

## 📈 Key Product Insights

- Premium plan users generated significantly higher lifetime value
- Retention drops sharply after Month 1
- Referral channel shows strongest long-term retention
• High acquisition ≠ high retention — paid channels drove volume/acquisition but lower LTV/retention.
• Engagement drop preceded churn, indicating potential early warning signals, Declining engagement was a strong early indicator of churn
• A small “Champion” segment contributed a disproportionate share of revenue, Champions segment contributes majority of total revenue.
• Retention stabilized after the third billing cycle — critical activation window. At-risk users show declining engagement before churn.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

- Improve onboarding flow to increase activation
- Optimize pricing & trial-to-paid transition
- Focus retention campaigns on high-value segments
- Invest more in high-LTV acquisition channels
- Implement churn prediction model

## 📊 Key Insights

### 📉 Retention Drop After 60 Days/ Early Churn is the Core Problem

Strong 30-day retention but a noticeable decline at 60–90 days — indicating engagement gaps post-trial.

Implication: Onboarding & activation improvements can drastically impact retention.

### 💰 Revenue is Highly Concentrated

Top 20% of users contribute a disproportionately large share of revenue.

### ⚠️ Cohort Quality Varies

Some acquisition cohorts show weaker long-term retention — suggesting channel quality differences.

Implication: Possible product-market fit or onboarding experience issue.


### 📈 📊LTV Distribution is Right-Skewed

A small high-value user segment drives significant revenue impact.

Implication: Growth strategy should balance acquisition + lifecycle optimization.
🔎 3. High LTV Users Are Long-Term Retained Users

Revenue compounds over time in subscription models.

Implication: Invest in engagement loops, loyalty benefits, renewal incentives.
